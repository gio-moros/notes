## Summary: The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People

by ExecutiveGrowth Summaries, summarizing Stephen R. Covey

### Introduction: Principles, Paradigms, and Habits

* Principles are the compass that show what actions move us toward our goals; paradigms show us the landscape we must cross; habits serve as the tools to traverse that space.
* Principles are the qualities of human character that have been lauded throughout history because they consistently prove effective.
* A paradigm forms the basis of how we see the world.
* Habits are the tools of your principles and enable you to act upon your paradigms.

### Part I: Ownership & Definition

#### 1. Principle of Ownership (Habit 1: Be Proactive)

* The Principle of Ownership says we have the capability to take control of our lives. In life, we either act or are acted upon.
* When maintaining ownership of our lives becomes a principle, we are forced to admit that *we* let ourselves go and *we* stopped trying. But it also gives us ownership over the successes of our lives.
* This paradigm shift paves the way for the first habit of *Be Proactive*.

#### 2. Principle of Direction (Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind)

* The Principle of Direction says that living an undirected life is untenable, and with the Principle of Ownership it argues for self-directed proactivity.
* The second habit is *Begin with the End in Mind*, so that our actions fit into the blueprint of our lives.
* As we adopt the habits, we grow through the *Maturity Continuum*, with the three stages of dependence, independence, and interdependence.
* The concept of *Centeredness* says that what we value most will determine other aspects of our lives – such as our self-esteem, relationships, and consistency.
* One of the biggest mistakes we all make is choosing entities rather than principles as our centers.
* If the center of our existence is the well being of an entity, then our state of mind becomes susceptible to everything that those entities are susceptible to.
* If we place immutable principles at our center, we remain steadfast in the face of whatever bad events may transpire to those entities.
* We all have roles, and the well-principled core informs us how to best fulfill those roles. By identifying our roles, we identify our long-term goals for our relationships.

### Part II: Progress & Achievement

#### 3. Principle of Individual Progress (Habit 3: First Things First)

* The Principle of Individual Progress says that individuals should become *more* capable over time rather than *less* capable.
* Living builds experience in every moment, and through experience we grow. Furthermore, it is through mindful experience that we grow toward a specific end.
* The third habit is *First Things First*, where the first things are whatever maximize production and increase production capability (called P/PC).
* To put first things first means to engage with activities that increase our production capability.
* We each have a *Circle of Concern*, within which is a *Circle of Influence* which contains those things that we can have an *immediate* effect on.
* When we spend time in the *Circle of Concern*, the *Circle of Influence* contracts as we lose out on opportunities to work within it.
* In a *Time Management Matrix*, we want to spend as much time in Quadrant 2 (Important & Not Urgent) since it boosts our production capability.
* To shrink Q1 (Important & Urgent) activities, eliminate Q3 and Q4 activities and substitute them with Q2 actions. Over time, Q2 actions will increase our PC, resulting in less Q1.

#### 4. Principle of Abundance (Habit 4: Think Win/Win)

* Two overlooked outcomes in addition to the normal win/lose breakdown:
  * Win: The concern is winning, and the outcome for the other party doesn't matter.
  * Win/Win or No Deal: Both parties commit to a Win/Win, and if none can be found then there are no hard feelings.
* The *Principle of Abundance* embraces an *Abundance Mentality*, which says there is more than enough for everyone.
* The *Scarcity Mentality* in business often gives rise to Win/Lose paradigms.
* The relationship between two parties improves when they find a Win/Win solution.
* If you are attempting to find a Win/Win solution but the other party does not trust you, then you must build *character* with them.
* Character means proving yourself by your actions repeatedly. The consistency of acting on our principles shows others that our actions will always be chosen according to those principles.
* The *Emotional Bank Account (EBA)* models building trust through character. It says that:
  1. We have a joint account with whomever we have a relationship with, and its currency is trust.
  2. Our actions are either deposits or withdrawals.
* Building the EPA is critical because strong relationships yield better opportunities for both parties, and enable Win/Win outcomes.
* A Win/Win or No Deal outcome preserves the relationship in the event that a solution cannot be found.
* If you can tolerate a Lose/Win outcome, then you can preserve the relationship and may thereby achieve a much larger win down the road.

#### 5. Principle of Effective Communication (Habit 5: Seek First to Understand, then to Be Understood)

* The fifth habit *Seek First to Understand, then to Be Understood* says that by listening and gathering information, we can proceed more effectively.
* By seeking first to be understood, you often come away from interactions with no new information.
* The *Principle of Effective Communication* maintains that it is better if our interactions yield growth.
* When your primary goal is to be heard, you are acting like you are struggling and you need to be validated and recognized.
* Listening supplies *Psychological Air*, which allows each party to share openly and feel heard, accepted, and understood. The resulting free flow of ideas can be exceptionally powerful.
* *Empathetic Listening* is listening where we seek first to understand the other person's paradigms and principles.
* Empathetic listening makes a large deposit in the EBA by showing other people that we value our common humanity more than we care about forcing our beliefs upon them.

#### 6. Principle of Team Execution (Habit 6: Synergy)

* Our psychological needs require maintenance in four areas: physical, spiritual, mental, and social.
* The *Principle of Team Execution* says that we need each other to thrive, and helps meet our social need.
* Along the *Maturity Continuum* of dependence, independence, and interdependence, our ideal state is on the border between independence and interdependence.
* The sixth habit, *Synergy*, happens when the team produces more than the sum of its parts and the production of ideas depends on the participation of each team member.
* Only when a high state of trust exists, and the Emotional Bank Accounts are rich, does synergy become possible.
* Unlike an ordinary team, each member of a synergistic group seeks the Win/Win outcome.
* *Negative Synergy* is when a group becomes so toxic that each member attempts to fail the project. In the end there may be no deal, but the EBA is now empty.
* Because negative synergy can be as powerful as synergy, it's crucial to approach team interaction with Win/Win or No Deal.

### Part III: Perpetual Growth

#### 7. Principle of Greater Attainment (Habit 7: Sharpen the Saw)

* The *Principle of Greater Attainment* says that our lives should reflect an *Upward Spiral* that comprises of learning, committing, and doing.
* The final habit *Sharpening the Saw* means that each day we take time to focus on obtaining a *Daily Private Victory*.
* This victory is won by engaging with the three independent dimensions of our lives: the mental, the physical, and the spiritual.
* To meet the social/emotional dimension, we use the *Daily Public Victory* where we find a way to assist our family, friends, or colleagues in some small way each day.
